Privacy has many facets. The issue of privacy bothers us in today's ever-more connected world because we do not control its manifestations. We see elaborate privacy policies, bills, laws and rights in place. Yet, it is difficult to build a right privacy-aware system for everyone given that the concept of privacy is highly subjective and is open to interpretations.

Before we dig deeper, let us take a look at a few manifestations of privacy in the domain of data transmission. Consider this:

> When we want to share information with others using technology, we are dependent on the technology we use to respect whether the information is delivered only to the intended recipient(s) or whether it is shared intentionally or unintentionally with other non-intended recipients.

If we ask under which conditions can we call such a system as "privacy aware", there can be multiple interpretations. There would be a set that would say that as long as their message reaches their recipients, they do not bother about other issues. Let us keep this set of people aside for a while and consider the other possibilities we may have. For instance, some others would say that as long as no one else (governments, corporations, parents, spouses, Sauron) sees it and it reaches the destination, it is fine. By those terms, when the information is delivered only to the intended recipients, we often call it a "privacy-aware" system. When the information is shared with non-intended recipients, we term it as a "privacy breach". Some others would argue that this is not enough. If the system stores the data that they had sent through that system, irrespective of whether the system makes use of that stored data now or in future, it violates privacy. An edge group would further add that as long as such a system stores data beyond the duration of the actual transmission, it is a violation of privacy, regardless of the intention.

That is a lot of opinions to take in, and this does not even represent the full spectrum of opinions. We see three patterns here already:

- One size does not fit all
- Many issues can get intertwined once you dig deeper; the way data usage became a concern in data transmission in the scenario above.
- People exchange privacy with comfort to certain degrees, often based on the amount of facilities offered.

I'll leave the solution for a later exercise. For now, let us focus on the issues at hand and try to isolate them.
