  <div itemprop="description">
      <p>I help emerging technologies gain wider adoption among developers and
      early enthusiasts. My work revolves around interdisciplinary roles where I
      bridge engineering with developer relations and sales.</p>

      <p>If you run a software or internet company with developer-facing
      products, especially in cutting-edge technologies, I can help you grow
      your developer outreach and build a sustainable ecosystem around your
      products that encourages developer participation.<p>

      <p>I also act as technical/developer contact in sales processes for tech
      companies, helping their customers understand the nuances of the product
      from both technical and business point of view.</p>

      <p>I currently help <a href="https://tokbox.com">TokBox</a>, one of the
      leaders in the WebRTC industry, to connect with developers in APAC,
      focusing on the Indian market. I co-founded <span itemprop="brand"

      href="http://applait.com"><span itemprop="name">Applait</span></a></span>,
      a product outfit working on techonologies that address challenges in
      communication we face today.</p>

      <p>Previously, I ran a software consultancy firm called CodeBinders, have
      been a Developer Evangelist for FusionCharts and worked as a developer at
      ThoughtWorks on the <a href="http://getgauge.io">Gauge</a> team.</p>
