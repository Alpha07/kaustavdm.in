This is the extract of the talk I was supposed to give at [Barcamp Bangalore Spring 2014](http://barcampbangalore.org/bcb/). It was a short presentation on the status of gathering information about web technologies and making them available publicly through resources like the [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org) and [WebPlatform](http://webplatform.org).

The target audience for this presentation were supposed to be newcomers to the field, so the presentation talks of everything at a very basic level.

## Talk Extract:





### What do you mean by the “open" web?





<blockquote>
  
> 
> 
  
>   * Publish content and applications on the web in open standards
> 
  
>   * Code and implement the web standards that that content/apps depend on
> 
  
>   * Access and use content / code / web-apps / implementations 
> 
  
</blockquote>



_Tantek Çelik_

In essence, the “open web” means to have the freedom to publish freely, develop transparent standards and enable access of the published content to everyone.

**Key takeaways:** transparent standards; information about them; easy consumption of those standards.



### Is it really open?



Yes till now, but it is tough to maintain. Each and every step towards censoring the internet, promoting proprietary standards and controlling information flow is a major disruption of openness of the web.



### What are the principles driving it?



Enable others. The willingness to share knowledge, the passion to build great products collaboratively, the courage to take a step towards doing something for others’ good.



### What technologies does it comprise of?



The latest technologies driving the web include:





  * HTML5


  * CSS3


  * SVG


  * WebGL


  * JavaScript


  * Web APIs





### Do we have enough information available for all the newer technologies out there?



These technologies are now real. They are used in everyday development. They have seen massive adoption in the last couple of years. But quality information on these topics still need to be collected and made accessible.

People write about these in their own blogs and in tech magazines. There is already a huge chunk of information floating out there. There is huge demand to have these information curated and made available through open platforms.



### Who need these information?







  * Everyday new developers need them to learn about these technologies,


  * people enhancing their skills in web development need them as reference,


  * people new to the web, who are getting introduced to technologies behind the web need these to learn.





### How do we make this information accessible to them?



We can always write more about it on our own blogs, but the current situation calls for a community effort. These information need to be collected, curated, build upon and put in open web platforms of knowledge sharing.

Two great platforms already available for such an effort are:





  * Mozilla Developer Network


  * WebPlatform





### How far have they succeeded?



MDN has a global volunteer base who drive the content. While MDN has in-depth information on a wide range of topics, it needs to be curated and made consumable for the regular people.

WebPlatform has just started. They are in alpha. They intend to cover all technologies that form the backbone of the web.



### Where can you contribute?



For MDN:





  * Help create page summaries and do editorial reviews of existing articles


  * Create live code samples


  * Do technical reviews of existing articles


  * Write a new article on a topic that you know about


  * Contribute to the code base of MDN



For WebPlatform:



  * Pick a topic which is in progress and help complete a section on it.


  * Review existing articles


  * Contribute to code base (It runs on MediaWiki!)





### What do you need to know or what skills do you need to contribute?







  * Any of the web technologies


  * A passion to write (content or code)


  * For webdevs, knowledge of Python for MDN and PHP for WebPlatform


  * Willingness to contribute to something large.
