This is the third set of images from our Nepal tour. This set covers our road to Pokhara, the first night at Pokhara and a visit to Sarangkot for sunrise next morning. All images at Sarangkot were shot by Nayanika.

The sunrise at Sarangkot was such wonderful(ly shot) that I decided to dedicate a set entirely for it.<!-- more -->
