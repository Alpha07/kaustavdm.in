The stable version of [Ubuntu 9.10 Karmic Koala](http://www.ubuntu.com/testing/karmic/beta) will be released on October 29, 2009. Presently it is in beta stage. Apart from developing useful codes, Ubuntu developers have a good choice of name.

For upgrading from previous versions of Ubuntu, [check here](http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/upgrading). For those using Ubuntu desktop, it can be easily upgraded over network from Update Manager in GNOME and using alternate CD.<!-- more -->

Kubuntu 8.1 can be updated through Adept Manager via network and Kubuntu 8.04 will need the following code: "_**update-notifier-kde -u".**_

**Â ****Users can also [request a free CD](https://shipit.ubuntu.com/), [download](http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/download) or [buy CDs and DVDs](http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/purchase) of Ubuntu 9.10 after the stable version is released. The present beta version has some bugs but it has been another good piece of work by the Ubuntu developers.
