One of the new features in Firefox DevTools is the ability to debug CSS pseudo-classes straight from the Inspector. This includes `:hover`, `:focus` and `:active`.

There is a new icon lodged neatly in the top right corner of the CSS pane of the DOM Inspector. Clicking it will toggle the pseudo classes. This makes debugging debugging these pseudo classes a breeze. :-)<!-- more -->
